          <div class="post-content">
            <p>2013 was a year of a lot of personal change. A relocation, new job and a milestone birthday happened not just in 2013 but within a quick 4 month period. The rather dizzying changes of this past year have left my head spinning, but now, as the spinning wears off, I’m looking forward to what a focused  2014 can bring.</p>
<p>In May of last year, I finally made the move to San Francisco. This was preceded by five years of visits to see my dear friend Lauren. I always enjoyed my time in San Francisco and let’s just say after five years of encouraging a move, I finally found the courage and will to get outside my comfort zone. I also found love. My partner, of now over one year, I met on one of many trips out to San Francisco. I took a risk on six months of distance--something very uncharacteristic of me--and have been rewarded with a loving relationship. And only after three months of living in San Francisco, I was honored to be selected as a Mayor’s Innovation Fellow with the <a href="http://innovatesf.com">San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Civic Innovation</a>.</p>
<p>Now here I am, a newly minted San Franciscan, in a relationship, at the age of 30, in a dream fellowship. I also landed in the midst of some tense times in San Francisco. It probably isn’t a surprise to you that San Francisco is rapidly changing, bringing to the surface many underlying tensions around housing, affordability, social services and the economy broadly. These are not necessarily new challenges or particularly unique to San Francisco, but I’d say, as a poster-child for tech sector innovation and growth, the challenges are felt acutely and amplified quickly. I’m not going to unpack these tensions here or offer yet another opinion on how we got here and how to fix it. There are <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/01/30/salesforce-ceo-benioff-on-how-to-fix-san-francisco/">plenty</a> <a href="https://medium.com/where-have-you-been-city-neighourhood-and-travel/ccb31944dce1">of</a> <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/How-San-Francisco-creates-its-own-housing-crisis-5139869.php">those</a> <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/01/16/sf_tech_backlash_google_buses_get_private_security_guards_says_reuters.html">circling</a> <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2014/01/visual-study-just-how-bad-tech-shuttles-are-san-francisco/8221/">around</a>. I have only a limited view of the complex interactions happening in my adopted home, so my most responsible action at this point is to listen. 2014 will be about furthering my commitment to respect, which will require making myself uncomfortable and challenging preconceived notions I may not even recognize.</p>
<p>If 2013 was about movement and change, 2014, I hope, is about rooting and understanding. It is very easy for anyone moving at the pace of modern life to forget to look around and take notice. This year, for me, is about intentionally exploring and understanding the world around me. I’m framing my intentional exploration around three themes: learning, generating and engaging. The following is not quite a New Year’s resolution but a New Year’s framework to focus on the things that will bring me closer to the person I want to be.</p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<p>I want to push myself to learn things I’ve put off and to deepen knowledge of things for which I am just beginning. Some new interests will emerge over this year, but I have a few goals in mind at the outset. For example, it’s about time I learn Spanish. There are many good reasons personally to learn new languages, and In a country with a growing Latino population, learning Spanish just makes sense, particularly to deepen cultural empathy and increase pathways for communication. I also look forward to deepening skills around design and development. I’ve been working increasingly with Node based applications and getting more into rapid prototyping and design. I feel this year is as good as any to start pulling together pieces and knitting them into a stronger core of skills to bring technology from user stories to wireframes to working prototypes and products.</p>
<h2 id="generating">Generating</h2>
<p>Over this year, I really want to deepen my generative capacity. From writing, to sketching, to building tools, the idea here is to pursue and deliver on a range of creative projects. Also, as much as possible, I want to put those projects out there. Whether it’s pushing code, writing a blog post or sharing other creative pursuits, I become better by creating out in the open so to speak. This exposes me up to feedback (hopefully constructive) and forces me to grow in confidence in my abilities. In tandem with learning, generating becomes a powerful force for personal (and possibly community) growth.</p>
<h2 id="engaging">Engaging</h2>
<p>Finally, in pursuit of strengthening my ties to the community around me, it is important for me to engage. This means purposefully finding ways to tie myself to those that I may not know now, but are my neighbors. Civic engagement is often strongest around elections, but there are ways to be consistently engaged in community. From community meetings to volunteering to attending events at the Public Library. There are many ways to be “in community” with people that go beyond our 9 to 5 jobs. The purpose this year is to do this intentionally instead of accidentally. I look forward to deepening community and truly engaging in the world around me.</p>
<h2 id="a-framework-not-a-resolution">A Framework, Not a Resolution</h2>
<p>So my New Year’s framework may not be as simple or clear as a couple of resolutions, but it’s something that resonates with the way I think. It gives me just enough clarity on direction without boxing me into a couple of promises I’ll make my present self without consideration for my future self. So how do I make this into something actionable? By building a simple feedback loop. Each week, I can ask myself the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have I done to learn, to generate, to engage?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In each category, I should have at least one thing I’ve done that week. If not, well, it’s not a complete failure, but now I know I should apply a little more energy in a certain direction. If I go weeks in a category without doing anything, I’ve got even more serious energy to apply and maybe a deeper checkin with myself to see what’s keeping me from accomplishing learning, generating or engaging activities. This requires honesty with myself, but also gentleness. We often beat ourselves up for not accomplishing a resolution or goal, focusing so narrowly on the outcome we forget to look at the whole. I’m pretty guilty of that myself.</p>
<p>This framework, if it works the way I envision, will help me advance in the direction of the person I am always becoming and hope to be. This year, then, will end with proud accomplishments, not because I’ve torn down the other, but because I’ve built myself up.</p>
