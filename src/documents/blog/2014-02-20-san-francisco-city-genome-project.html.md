This past weekend, Katie Johnson ([@aStateOfKate][1]) and I endeavored down a path to map the organizational structure of the City and County of San Francisco. This may sound like a rather esoteric, dare I say even boring, task, but it’s actually quite a bit fun and I hope enlightening not just to Katie and I but to others.

San Francisco is approximately [28,000 employees][2], with 50+ departments, agencies, commissions and other major units of government and about an [$8 billion][3] [budget][4]. Needless to say, it is a large and complex organism. Mapping the organizational structure of the City, for me, is like mapping the genome (albeit way less expensive and much easier than say mapping an actual genome). This underlying structure implies the way in which the City operates. Having this context is key for anyone who wants to improve the civic aspect of living here.

Having been a fellow at the Mayor’s Office for Civic Innovation now for six months, I’m no expert on all the myriad functions city government performs for its citizens, but I have been here just long enough to become very curious. This project is an attempt to turn tacit knowledge on the structure and operation of the City into structured data. Data that is hopefully useful to others for a myriad of reasons.

![The goal is to turn charts like these into structured data you can open up in a spreadsheet and visualize in a number of ways][5]
*This project attempts to turn charts like the one above into structured data you can open up in a spreadsheet and visualize.*

The goal of this genome project is to map out both the formal and informal structures of the City. The first step focuses on mapping those established structures of government embodied in the org charts of departments. Once these relationships are described, then the informal, functional relationships can be layered on top. For example, there are many divisions of many departments that touch aspects of neighborhood development that aren’t formally bound together but coordinate and collaborate because of the nature of the work. The [Better Market Street Project][6] is one of many examples of this kind of cross-department collaboration.

If this serves nothing else, this is a research project that will produce a well documented and centralized resource to benefit others on a similar path. At its best, the data generated in this research benefits other possible uses. For example, it could possibly:

- Give researchers better understanding of how information flows through the City
- Give designers and user researchers better situational context as they build new applications used by public sector employees
- Help citizens understand the organization they have working for them.
- Give civil servants tools to document knowledge as it relates to the overall structure of government
- And so on...

The research is currently being documented in a [Google Spreadsheet][7]. There are two tabs, one with a list of all the departments and a link to the relevant org chart and a second with the starting point for describing these org charts in a structured format. Ultimately, we’ll want to visualize the formal and informal relationships. So you’ll see a column for node and a column for parent. These indicate the basic hierarchical “edges” if we’re talking in terms of graphs. Put more simply, the node is every department, division, or unit of government, and its parent is the immediate link up the chain of command in the org chart.

If you’re interested in learning more about the project or collaborating with us, drop us a line ([Katie][8] and [I][9] are both easy to find on Twitter). The more the merrier!
