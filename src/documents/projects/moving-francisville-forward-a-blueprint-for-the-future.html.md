In 2006, I worked on the tail end of a plan being produced by Interface Studio in Philadelphia for the Francisville Neighborhood Development Corporation (FNDC).  For the plan, I produced a photo-simulation for a community garden to show how a vacant lot could be transformed into a community asset.  These images were part of the final plan document.
