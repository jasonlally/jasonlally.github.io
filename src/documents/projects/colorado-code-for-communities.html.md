Colorado Code for Communities is an initiative I used to lead as Director of the Decision Lab at PlaceMatters.  It started in July 2012 with the first civic hackathon in Denver, out of which came two winning apps, OpenBike and EndPoint.  Following the hackathon, regular meetups began and in September when the group became an official Code for America Brigade, and I became one of the Brigade Captains accepted into the inaugural class.  Among the regular meetups, the group works on building the infrastructure for civic innovation in Denver and beyond.  In January 2013, regular hack nights gave a common place for people to come together and work on developing solutions for some of our most pressing 21st century community problems.

The group is now led by Joanne Cheng. You can take part by attending local meetups, hack nights, and keeping tabs on the Code for Communities GitHub.

I built the landing page on a simple Twitter Bootstrap template page forked from Code for Virginia Beach (another CFA Brigade).  Bret Fisher coded the original template and I modified it for the needs of our group.  The website is deployed via GitHub pages so that multiple people can easily edit and work on the site together.
