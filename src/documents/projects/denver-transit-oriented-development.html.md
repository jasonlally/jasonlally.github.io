Denver has gone through many changes recently around Transit Oriented Development.  As FastTracks builds out into existing communities, planners need to help current businesses and residents understand ways in which future development could be affected by planning and market factors.  I developed these illustrative photo simulations based on recommended height and setback requirements for two transit neighborhoods.  One illustration was of the 10th and Osage stop on the existing Southwest line and the other was around 40th and Fox street where planning for a new line is underway.

The Denver Department of Community Planning and Development used these in public meetings, reports and applications for funding around mixed income development projects.
