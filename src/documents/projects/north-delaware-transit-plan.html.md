In 2006-2007, I worked at Interface Studio in Philadelphia on the North Delaware Transit Plan.  Interface Studio developed the plan around the R7 Septa corridor and involved studying 5 station areas in terms of demographics, history, accessibility and commuter behavior.  I provided support in research, GIS and mapping, and graphics.
