I was the lead developer of [Brainstorm Anywhere](http://www.brainstormanywhere.net) while at [PlaceMatters](http://www.placematters.org). It helped us carry out large group decision-making and brainstorming.  Brainstorm Anywhere allows us to hold large meetings and move toward consensus easier by providing easy polling support, reporting functionality, and data mining.

I built Brainstorm Anywhere in Codeigniter, a PHP MVC framework, and it's on scalable RedHat OpenShift infrastructure.  I managed the backend as well as developed the database, code and interface.  You can see the development version of Brainstorm Anywhere [hosted on OpenShift here](http://www.brainstormanywhere.net).
